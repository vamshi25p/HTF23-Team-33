Problems Statement:
Create a web app or mobile app where the questions are divided into different sets of categories, and you can have a checklist of what needs to be done and what is completed. You will need to create a roadmap for beginners depending on their skills, how much they know, and how much they will have to learn. Also, creating topic-wise progress for each user profile would be helpful for the users to track their personal progress.
